# NLP-Language-Detector
I wish to introduce you to an amazing project, the Language Detection model using Natural Language Processing. This will take you through a real-world example of ML(application to say).Using the text we have to create a model which will be able to predict the given language. This is a solution for many artificial intelligence applications and computational linguists. These kinds of prediction systems are widely used in electronic devices such as mobiles, laptops, etc for machine translation, and also on robots. It helps in tracking and identifying multilingual documents too. The domain of NLP is still a lively area of researchers.
